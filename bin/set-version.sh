# the library: the README badge, package.json, and composer.json. Cassette-CMF
# is a Composer library rather than a standalone plugin, so there is no plugin
# header or runtime version constant to update — but Abstract_Handler::get_version()
# already reads composer.json's "version" key at runtime for asset
# cache-busting, falling back to a file-mtime timestamp when it's unset. This
# keeps that field populated with the real release version. Per-file
# @version/@since docblocks are intentionally left untouched.
#
# Usage: bin/set-version.sh <version>
#   <version> may be given as "0.4.0" or "v0.4.0"; a single leading "v" is
#   stripped and the normalized "0.4.0" form is written everywhere.
